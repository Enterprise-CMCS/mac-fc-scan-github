  "description": "A microservice sending CMS Medicaid Model Data Lab (MMDL) data to CMS Bigmac.",
  "longDescription": "The mmdl-connectors project is a production microservice deployed to AWS that streams CMS Medicaid Model Data Lab (MMDL) data from Oracle database to CMS Bigmac's Kafka cluster in real-time. It leverages Kafka Connect service deployed to ECS Fargate with a JDBC Source connector that monitors MMDL's Oracle database for data changes and streams them to topics in CMS Bigmac. The system includes multiple integrated services: connector service for data streaming, ksqlDB for data processing and table creation, alerts service for monitoring, and dashboard service for visualization. AWS Lambda functions handle topic creation, deployment operations, and configuration management. The architecture includes automated password management with EventBridge handlers that respond to AWS Secrets Manager changes, ensuring continuous operation during scheduled maintenance windows. The solution provides real-time healthcare data analytics capabilities for CMS Medicaid operations with comprehensive monitoring through AWS CloudWatch and automated alerting systems.",
